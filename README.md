# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

While working on the project, I wanted to share an idea on how to improve the webpage. I would like to have quick access links to all of the briefs for the current project on one page. I would be able to quicky locate each brief by order to help make corrections needed after review.
